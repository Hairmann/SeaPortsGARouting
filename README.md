# SeaPortsGARouting
Attempt at porting TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem) solver with Genetic Algorithms (GA) from CLI C# to WPF C#.
Many functions are absent, but it serves as a prototype for desktop app design.
You can put in the number of sea ports in the route of a vessel, number of steps performed by the GA. Then press <Generate> ("Сгенерировать"), then press Run! ("Начать!"). The algorithm will try to solve the TSP and show the result on the canvas on the right. The result is also logged into the log field at the bottom of the screen. Sea ports may be positioned only in the form of a circle in this version.

To run the app please use Release\SeaPortsGenetic_WPF.exe
